As we start a new year, I have decided to finally create and publish my personal
website, as well as attempt to maintain a blog (what you are reading now). In
this first post, I want to talk about why I am choosing to start a blog when
blogs as a concept are declining in popularity.

There is no shortage of content on the Internet. On the contrary, with the proliferation
of social media platforms and LLMs, I feel it is relatively uncontroversial
to suggest that the Internet might have too much content. In recent months I have
seen a growing sentiment that search engines have gotten worse in an effort to
steer users towards AI-based alternatives. Perhaps, instead, the Internet has
simply gotten harder to search.

It has certainly become harder to access information as a user.
Blogs & forums have historically been treasure troves of information, especially
when the content was posted by a subject matter expert. Nowadays, more and more
expertise is being locked up in walled gardens, such as Discord servers or even
traditional social media sites like Twitter/Facebook/Instagram. Content on these
sites generally receives little to no indexing by search engines, and may not
be possible for humans to access without creating an account.

A related trend I have seen is that users invest far less effort in learning
or researching how to solve their problem. For several years I provided active
support in my Discord community for Minecraft modding. It is important to note
that mods primarily appeal to a younger audience, and so the user behavior patterns
I saw there may not translate to the Internet at large. Still, I noticed a trend
of newer users lacking initiative to look for existing solutions to their problem
or at least collect as much useful information as possible
for the person helping them. It is tempting (and easy) to blame them, the environment
that neglected to teach them this skill, or various other factors. But again, perhaps
the problem is much simpler: can they even readily find the info we expect them to?

Discord forums offer a search feature, but it is rather simplistic, and relies
on user posts to have clear and distinct summaries. The classic paradigm of searching
for information breaks down in an era of unprecedented complexity in the tools
and world we use & live in today.

I would like to propose that perhaps blogs, for all their faults (lack of peer
review, ephemerality) do a good job of solving these problems. Blogs are rather
easy to index and search. They are typically public sites that require no authentication
to access. Each post tends to focus on a single topic, and today's LLMs offer a
potential path to SEO for authors without time to write explicit keywords and summaries.
I may be wrong in this proposal, but at the very least, the information I choose
to publish here will not be forgotten so easily as in a random Discord server. :)

I don't yet know what topics will be a focus on this blog. Most will likely
be more technical rather than philosophical like this, but it really depends
on my time and interest.
If this sort of content interests you, consider checking back in for a new post
in the future!
